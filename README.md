# alien-banking-botnet-apk

Alien Banking Botnet is a banking trojan that runs on Android devices. It was first discovered in early 2021 and has quickly become one of the most dangerous banking trojans in the world.

Alien is designed to steal victims' credentials from their banking apps. To do this, it installs a malicious app on the victim's device and then takes screenshots of the banking apps. It then uses these screenshots to obtain the victim's credentials.

Alien is particularly dangerous because it has the ability to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA is an additional security layer that requires a user to have a security code in addition to their credentials. Alien can install a TeamViewer app on the victim's device and then use that app to remotely access the device to steal the 2FA code.

Alien targets over 226 banking apps, including:

Bank of America,
Chase,
Wells Fargo,
Citibank,
Capital One,
PayPal,
Venmo,
Google Pay,
Apple Pay

This is an important development for security researchers and experts. The APK and source code can be used to gain a better understanding of how Alien operates. This information can be utilized to develop new methods for detecting and preventing Alien. Additionally, you can use the APK code as a reference to develop your own software.
